# India IFSC and MICR codes
IFSC codes are maintained by RBI. They are available on the RBI website on this webpage - https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/neft.aspx. The link "List of NEFT enabled bank branches (Consolidated IFS Codes)" is the best source of information since it consolidates all the codes into one excel file.
